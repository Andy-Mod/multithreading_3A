## Tests Results and Conclusions

### Performance Results Overview

#### Impact of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
Performance varies significantly depending on whether `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to `Release` or not.

#### Choice of Eigen Solvers
We evaluated the performance using two Eigen solvers:
- `colPivHouseholderQr`
- `householderQr`

These solvers were chosen for the following reasons:
1. **Accuracy**: According to the Eigen documentation, these solvers provide high accuracy and do not require the input matrix `A` to meet specific conditions such as being:
   - Invertible
   - Positive definite
   - Negative definite
   - Semi-definite
2. **Prioritizing Accuracy Over Speed**: While other solvers may offer better performance, our focus was on maintaining accuracy without compromising computational integrity.

The following sections compare the results before and after setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`, using the `colPivHouseholderQr` solver.

The testing was performed on a set of tasks with the following sizes: `sizes = [9990, 6900, 4200, 100, 1000, 10000, 2989, 3080, 8398, 1162, 761]`. These tasks were executed first in `C++` using a `Minion` and then in `Python`.


#### Tests using the solver `colPivHouseholderQr`

In `Debug` build type, here are the results we got:

```bash

```

As illustrated in the figure above, the tasks are generally faster in `Python`. The performance gap becomes more pronounced as the problem size increases.

For instance:
- Smaller tasks, such as tasks 10, 100, and 761, showed similar execution times in both `C++` and `Python`.
- In contrast, larger tasks like task 6900 took significantly longer in `C++`, exceeding by more that 47 seconds.

Switching to `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release`, here are the results :

```bash

As observed, there are performance improvements, with execution times in `C++` generally being slightly faster. However, `C++` remains overall slower than `Python`.

Compared to the `colPivHouseholderQr` solver, we observe significant speed improvements. However, `Python` executions remain overall faster and more accurate.

In `Release` build type, here are the results we got:

As illustrated in the figure above, the tasks are still generally faster in `Python`, but performance is significantly better in `C++`, with almost the same level of accuracy.

#### Tests using the solver `householderQr` and `OpenMP` in `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release`

##### Optimizing Task Execution Performance in `C++`

In this section, we aim to optimize the performance of task execution in `C++` by enabling parallel computation in `Eigen` using `OpenMP`. Parallelization should improve the speed of the operations, especially for large size problems.

###### Approach

We will evaluate the performance using different numbers of threads:
- **2 threads**
- **4 threads**
- **8 threads**

The results will then be compared individually to the performance of tasks executions in `Python`.

Here are the results with :
- **2 threads**

Overall, we observe significant speed improvements. However, `Python` executions remain overall faster and more accurate.

### Conclusion

Switching the build type of the `C++ Minion` to `Release` significantly improves performance. However, the `numpy` library remains considerably faster and more accurate compared to the `Eigen` library.

In our tests, enabling parallelism with `OpenMP` improved performance but not as much as anticipated, resulting in an overall **3% reduction in computation time**.
